It contains step by step procedure to run the simulator of virtual lab experiment
1.	Click on the simulation button to open the simulator.
2.	Switch ON the simulator Enable power button to work on the simulator.
3.	Then from the place equipments area select the equipments according to the instruction to make connection in the working canvas area.
4.	After placing the all equipment connect devices with wires.
5.	Once the circuit connection is completed then switch ON the power supply of the circuit and select the multiplying factor of the wattmeter.
6.	Then output power is shown in the output meter window along with voltmeter reading and ammeter reading.
7.	Repeat the step 5 for another value of multiplying factor and note down the output reading.
8.	Therefore, from this reading user will calculate the power consumed by fluorescent lamp and finally the power factor of the circuit.
